DevFeed
===

DevFeed is a communications tool for developers that allows them to share messages in real time,
with history support (for when you're afk).

There will be two clients available:

0. Console
  * Pull up a terminal, execute devfeed and you're ready to roll.
0. Web
  * Navigate to your company's devfeed site and you're ready to roll.

This is kind of a stripped down cross between IRC and twitter.
